## Feedback
Quality of Code: Some session issues. Spacing could be improved.

1. Interface to insert and search data via forms: Can only select events by name.

2. The PWA: Cannot see or create events or stories while offline.

3. NodeJS Server: Could use more detail in solution and requirements.

4. Searching: Could use more detail in solution and requirements.

5. MongoDB: Does not sync with IndexedDB. Could use more detail in solution, requirements and limitations.

Quality Considerations: Some use of WebRTC.

Documentation: Could further improve use of JSDoc and comments.
